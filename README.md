# Image_Classifier_with_Tensorflow
Deep Learning Project on Oxford102 dataset
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. I used a dataset from Oxford containing 102 flower categories.
